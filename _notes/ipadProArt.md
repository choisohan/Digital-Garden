# Painting Application


## Procreate
the best painting option on ipad so far



## Adobe Fresco
con
- Too....!!!!slow to open rhe app and document
- Not all brushes are free
- lots of features from procreates are missing on this.
- dynamic watercolor/oil brushes workinf on the smaller resolution

-> personally gave up using fresco because of the loading speed... 




## Affinity Designer
awesome vector software. cheaper than adobe illustrator as well


## Concepts
one of my fav simple vector drawing app
missing a few features tho
-no blendinf mode
-mask layer
but still good, love this app







# Coding Application
