# 1. Concepts
When I think back, Somehow the reason why I chose the life from the ocean as my first one is not coincident with the fact that all earth-life came from the ocean.
Because I started from this

![Day1. Procedural spine motion test](assets/beluga/day1_dolphinProxy3.gif)

Making full limbs procedurally moving is not easy. there is gravity, complex muscles and joint system. there are too many things to consider to simulate it in real time. but hey, how about whales? Isn't it basically a big spine?

I quickly tested spine motion. I animated one of parent joint up and down and all the child joints motion is created procedurally in real time.

# 5. What are left?​

This project is still going on. There are a few improvements for beluga whale's look and performance.  I may fully reprogram the behaviour in a cleaner code. Other than that, I am looking for the time I can display this interactive beluga to People as cruelty-free whale exhibit.
