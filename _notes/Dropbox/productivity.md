# 1. The Best NoteTaking tools
I am using three note taking system
1. [[notion]] => daily log
2. [[obsidian]] => wikipage
3. [[typora]] x [[dropbox]] x [[write1]] => for personal note
4. [[Google Keep]] => quick note taking for instant thoughts.

### Desktop Stickynote
* [[Simple sticky note]] -> [link](https://www.simplestickynotes.com/)
Better than ms sticky note beacause.. it can be always on the top!
(why you don't do this ms, dummies?)


### Other tools I tried but not really keen to
- airtable 🤮



# 2. Task Management

|                  | Min's Experience        | Pro                            | con                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[notion]]       | Min's Primary tool      | Handy 👍                       | No recursive task available(you need other service to mix)            |
| [[todoist]]      |                         | complex program recussive task | My mistake but I put too many tasks and quit using it by overwhelming |
| [[MS To Do]]     | Personal item checklist | UI is pretty                   | no location based reminder + so little task setup compare to todoist  |
| [[Google Tasks]] |                         |                                | feel like working..                                                   |
| [[Google Keep]]  |                         |                                |                                                                       |

# 4. Collaboration Tools
### [[Calendly]] , the great way to share my availbility to set meeting time with teams in the different time zone

Pro
-  Freemium
- lots of integration tools such as [[zapier]]
- gmail extension and time pool option is really useful 
 
Con
- Customize color option is not available for free user

* Trouble shoot : "I look free while I am busy on google calendar!""
1. go to google calendar setting
2. genernal -> events from gmail -> privacy of email events : **calendar default**
